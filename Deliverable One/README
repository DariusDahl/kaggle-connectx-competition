ConnectX Agents: One-Step and N-Step Lookahead Strategies
This project focuses on implementing and comparing multiple AI agents for the ConnectX competition on Kaggle. The agents utilize different strategies, including one-step lookahead, n-step lookahead, and minimax algorithms.


Agents Implemented
The following agents are included in this project:
    1. Default Agent (Default_Given.py): The default agent provided by Kaggle to test that submissions are working.
    2. Q4 Agent (Q4_Given.py): Another agent using strategies from the ConnectX competition. Slightly more advanced.
    3. One-Step Lookahead Agent (One_Step_Lookahead_Given.py): An agent that looks one move ahead to decide the next move.
    4. N-Step Lookahead Agent (N_Step_Lookahead_Given.py): A direct implementation from Kaggle, using a multi-step lookahead strategy.
    5. N-Step Lookahead Minimax Agent (N_Step_Lookahead_Minimax.py): An enhancement of the n-step lookahead agent using the minimax algorithm for better decision-making.
These agents can be used to compete in the Kaggle ConnectX environment by submitting them through the provided submission.py file.

Note:
The files with "Given" in the title are direct copies from Kaggle and are meant to be run as they are. When executed, they will overwrite the current submission.py file, which can then be submitted directly to the competition.


Setup Instructions
Step 1: Ensure that the following dependencies are installed before running the project:
    1. Python: Make sure Python is installed. You can download it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
    2. Kaggle Environments: Install this dependency to simulate the ConnectX environment.
        Run the following command:
            pip install kaggle-environments

Step 2: Download the Project
    Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Step 3: Install Dependencies - requirements.txt
Locate the requirements.txt file in the directory for this project. Go to the terminal and make sure you are in that same directory.
Next, run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all package dependencies. After doing so, you should now be able to work with the files included.

Step 4: Run the Agents
    To run any of the provided agents, execute their respective Python files. For example:
       Type "python N_Step_Lookahead_Minimax.py" into the terminal to run it OR
       Run the file by pressing the 'Run Code' button, usually located in the upper right-hand corner of your IDE, if it is supported.


Generating and Running HTML to Visualize the Game
To visualize the game in your browser, you can generate HTML code using the environment render method. Here’s how:
    1. Uncomment the following code in any of the agent files (Default_Given.py, One_Step_Lookahead.py, etc.), which is located 13-14 lines above the bottom:
        htmloutput = env.render(mode="html")
        print(htmloutput)
    2. Run the file. The HTML code will be output to the terminal.
    3. Copy the HTML code:
        Select the terminal window and press CTRL-A to select all the text, then copy it.
    4. Paste the HTML code into a new HTML file (PyCharm and VSCode both support HTML documents).
    5. Clean the HTML file:
        Delete all lines above the line starting with <!DOCTYPE html> (this line must remain, as it is the start of the HTML document).
        Delete a few lines at the bottom, ensuring that the last line in the file is </html>.
    6. Run the HTML file:
        In PyCharm, hover your mouse over the top-right corner of the file, and you should see an option to launch the document in your browser.
        In VSCode, go to the "Run" button in the top-left corner and select "Run Without Debugging."
This should launch the game in your default browser, allowing you to visualize the gameplay.


Acknowledgments
This project was developed using code from the Kaggle ConnectX competition. Specifically, the Default_Given.py, Q4_Given.py, One_Step_Lookahead_Given.py, and N_Step_Lookahead_Given.py files are directly obtained from Kaggle. We would like to thank Kaggle for providing these resources and the ConnectX competition environment.
